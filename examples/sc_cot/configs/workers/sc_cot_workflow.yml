Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$. \nFinal Answer: [2,5)\n\n\nProblem: \nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\nSolution: We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$ \nFinal Answer: 24\n\n\nProblem: \nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?\nSolution: If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n            \\begin{align*}\n            30n&=480\\\n            \\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n            \\end{align*} \nFinal Answer: 16\n\n\nProblem: \nIf the system of equations\n            \\begin{align*}\n            6x-4y&=a,\\\n            6y-9x &=b.\n            \\end{align*}\n            has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\nSolution: If we multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain $$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have $$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$ \nFinal Answer: -\\frac{2}{3}\nProblem: {{query}}\nSolution:"
